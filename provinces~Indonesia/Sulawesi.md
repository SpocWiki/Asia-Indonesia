Three gulfs separate these peninsulas: the Gulf of Tomini between the northern Minahasa and East peninsulas, the Tolo Gulf between the East and Southeast peninsulas, and the Gulf of Boni between the South and Southeast peninsulas. The Strait of Makassar runs along the western side of the island and separates the island from Borneo.
