> **Srivijaya** (Indonesian: Sriwijaya), also spelled Sri Vijaya or Sriwijaya, 
> was a Malay thalassocratic empire based on the island of Sumatra (in modern-day Indonesia) 
> that influenced much of Southeast Asia. 
> 
> Srivijaya was an important centre for the expansion of Buddhism from the 7th to 11th century. 
> 
> Srivijaya was the first polity to dominate much of western Maritime Southeast Asia. 
> Due to its location, Srivijaya developed complex technology using maritime resources. 
> In addition, its economy became progressively reliant on the booming trade in the region, 
> thus transforming it into a prestige goods-based economy.
>
> The earliest reference to it dates from the 7th century. 
> A Tang dynasty Chinese monk, Yijing, wrote that he visited Srivijaya in 671 for six months. 
> 
> The earliest known inscription in which the name Srivijaya appears also 
> dates from the 7th century in the Kedukan Bukit inscription found near Palembang, Sumatra, 
> dated 16 June 682. 
> 
> Between the late 7th and early 11th century, 
> Srivijaya rose to become a hegemon in Southeast Asia. 
> 
> It was involved in close interactions, often rivalries, with the neighbouring 
> Mataram, Khom or Khmer Empire and Champa. 
> 
> Srivijaya's main foreign interest was nurturing lucrative trade agreements with China 
> which lasted from the Tang to the Song dynasty. 
> 
> Srivijaya had religious, cultural and trade links with the Buddhist Pala of Bengal, 
> as well as with the Islamic Caliphate in the Middle East.
>
> Srivijaya is widely recognized as a powerful maritime kingdom in Southeast Asia. 
> New research shows that while it had significant land-based elements, 
> Srivijaya leveraged its maritime fleet not only for logistical support 
> but also as a primary tool to project power across strategic waterways, 
> such as the Strait of Malacca. 
> 
> In response to the ever-changing dynamics of Asia’s maritime economy, 
> the kingdom developed sophisticated naval strategies 
> to maintain its position as a regional trade hub. 
> 
> These strategies involved regulating trade routes 
> and attracting merchant ships to their ports through strict control. 
> 
> As threats grew, Srivijaya’s fleet also transformed into an effective offensive force, 
> used to protect trade interests while ensuring their dominance in the region.
>
> The kingdom may have disintegrated after 1025 CE 
> following several major raids launched by the Chola Empire upon their ports. 
> 
> Chinese sources continued to refer a polity named Sanfoqi 
> thought to be Srivijaya for a few centuries, 
> but some historians argued that Srivijaya would no longer be the appropriate name 
> for the overlord's centre after 1025, when Sanfoqi referred to Jambi. 
> 
> After Srivijaya fell, it was largely forgotten. 
> 
> It was not until 1918 that French historian George Cœdès, of the French School of the Far East, 
> formally postulated its existence.
