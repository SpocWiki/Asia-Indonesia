> **Kalimantan** (/ˌkɑlɪˈmɑntɑn/; Indonesian pronunciation: [kaliˈmantan]) 
> is the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo. 
> It constitutes 73% of the island's area, and consists of the provinces of Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan. 
> The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are Brunei and East Malaysia. 
> In Indonesia the whole island of Borneo is also called "Kalimantan".
>
> In 2019, President of Indonesia Joko Widodo proposed that Indonesia's capital be moved to Kalimantan. The People's Consultative Assembly approved the Law on State Capital in January 2022. The future capital, Nusantara, is a planned city that will be carved out of East Kalimantan. A government official said construction is expected to be fully complete by 2045, but the unfinished capital officially celebrated Indonesian Independence Day for the first time and it was scheduled to be inaugurated as the capital city on 17 August 2024, but the move did not take place due to delays of construction.
