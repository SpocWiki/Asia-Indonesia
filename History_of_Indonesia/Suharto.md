## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Suharto** (8 June 1921 – 27 January 2008) was an Indonesian military general and politician 
> who served as the country's second and longest-serving president. 
> 
> Widely regarded as a military dictator by international observers, 
> Suharto led Indonesia as an authoritarian regime from 1967 until his resignation in 1998 
> following nationwide unrest. 
> 
> His 31-year dictatorship is considered one of the most brutal and corrupt of the 20th century: 
> he was central to the perpetration of mass killings against alleged communists 
> and subsequent persecution of ethnic Chinese, irreligious people, and trade unionists.
>
> Suharto was born in Kemusuk, near the city of Yogyakarta, during the Dutch colonial era. 
> He grew up in humble circumstances. 
> 
> His Javanese Muslim parents divorced not long after his birth, 
> and he lived with foster parents for much of his childhood. 
> 
> During the Japanese occupation, 
> Suharto served in the Japanese-organized Indonesian security forces. 
> 
> During Indonesia's independence struggle, he joined the newly formed Indonesian Army 
> and rose to the rank of major general some time after full Indonesian independence was achieved. 
> 
> An attempted coup on 30 September and 1 October 1965 
> was countered by Suharto-led troops. 
> 
> The army subsequently led a nationwide violent anti-communist purge. 
> In March 1967, the MPRS appointed Suharto as acting President, 
> and he was appointed President the following year. 
> 
> When Suharto came to power, inflation was running at over 650%. 
> He appointed an economic advisory group that implemented free market policies, 
> and by 1969 the country entered a period of price stability. 
> 
> Suharto ordered an invasion of East Timor in 1975, followed by a 23-year occupation of the country and genocide.
>
> Under his "New Order" regime, Suharto established a strong, centralised government dominated by the military, evolving from an initial oligarchic military dictatorship into a deeply authoritarian state centred on a cult of personality that elevated him as the nation's undisputed leader. His staunch anti-communist stance and ability to maintain political stability across Indonesia's vast and diverse archipelago secured significant economic and diplomatic backing from Western powers, particularly the United States, during the Cold War. During much of his presidency, Indonesia underwent rapid industrialisation, sustained economic growth (with GDP growing at around 7% per annum,) improved education, and a rise in domestic entrepreneurship, developments that led the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to name him "Father of Development" (Indonesian: Bapak Pembangunan) in 1982. In 1986, he was awarded the Ceres Medal by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for achieving self-sufficiency in rice production. However, by the 1990s, his regime's increasing authoritarianism and widespread corruption fueled public dissatisfaction, which reached a breaking point during the 1997 Asian financial crisis that plunged the country into economic turmoil and widespread unrest. Under immense pressure, Suharto resigned in May 1998 after more than three decades in power.
>
> Suharto died in January 2008 and received a state military funeral with full honors. The Indonesian government declared a week of national mourning. Suharto's 32-year presidency and legacy are highly divisive, and he remains a controversial figure within the Indonesian general public. He has been praised for making Indonesia into an economic success story, bringing stability to the region particularly during the Cold War period, and led Indonesia when it played a significant role in international affairs. However, others have denounced his authoritarian rule, widespread corruption, and extensive human rights violations (such as a violent anti-communist purge prior to his rule and subsequent repression of Chinese culture in Indonesia). Plans to award the status of National Hero to Suharto are being considered by the Indonesian government and have been debated vigorously. Such plans were subsequently acknowledged, with Suharto being granted the National Hero status on 10 November 2025. This decision sparked nationwide controversy and debate regarding his status. While many argue his contributions led to the exceeding development of Indonesia and it's economic stability, others argue his political actions, especially his countless human rights violations during his regime, should have been taken into consideration.
