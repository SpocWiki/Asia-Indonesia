> The Dutch East Indies, also known as the Netherlands East Indies 
> (Dutch: Nederlands(ch)-Indië; Indonesian: Hindia Belanda), 
> was a Dutch colony with territory mostly comprising the modern state of Indonesia, 
> which declared independence on 17 August 1945. 
> 
> Following the Indonesian War of Independence, 
> Indonesia and the Netherlands made peace in 1949. 
> 
> In the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, the Dutch ceded the governorate of Dutch Malacca to Britain, 
> leading to its eventual incorporation into Malacca (state) of modern Malaysia.
>
> The Dutch East Indies was formed from the 
> nationalised trading posts of the Dutch East India Company, 
> which came under the administration of the Dutch government in 1800. 
> 
> During the 19th century, the Dutch fought many wars against indigenous rulers and peoples, 
> which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. 
> 
> Dutch rule reached its greatest territorial extent in the early 20th century 
> with the occupation of Western New Guinea. 
> 
> The Dutch East Indies was one of the most valuable colonies under European rule, 
> though its profits depended on exploitative labor.
>
> The colony contributed to Dutch 
> global prominence in spice and cash crop trade in the 19th century, 
> and coal and oil exploration in the 20th century. 
> 
> The colonial social order was rigidly racial 
> with the Dutch elite living separately from but linked to their native subjects. 
> 
> The term Indonesia was used for the geographical location after 1880. 
> In the early 20th century, local intellectuals conceived Indonesia as a nation state, 
> setting the stage for an independence movement.
>
> Japan's World War II occupation dismantled much of the Dutch colonial state and economy. 
> Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, 
> Indonesian nationalist leaders Sukarno and Hatta declared independence, 
> instigating the Indonesian National Revolution. 
> 
> The Dutch, aiming to re-establish control of the archipelago, 
> responded by deploying roughly 220,000 troops, 
> who fought the Indonesian nationalists in attrition warfare. 
> 
> The United States threatened to terminate financial aid for the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan 
> if they did not agree to transfer sovereignty to Indonesia, 
> leading to Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty 
> at the 1949 Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference. 
> 
> Indonesia became one of the leading nations of the 
> Asian independence movement after World War II. 
> 
> During the revolution and after Indonesian independence, 
> almost all Dutch citizens repatriated to the Netherlands.
>
> In 1962, the Dutch turned over their last possession in Southeast Asia, 
> Dutch New Guinea (Western New Guinea), to Indonesia 
> under the provisions of the New York Agreement. 
> At that point, the entirety of the colony ceased to exist.
